GOAL:
The goal of the game is to get as high a score as possible. Your current score is displayed in the top-left corner while you are playing the game. And your high score is displayed in the middle of the screen at the start screen.

HOW TO PLAY:
Hover over the buttons and press and release the [left mouse button] to activate the button.

Press "Start" to start the game.

The player is the red ball in the middle of the screen once the game starts.

While you are playing the game, hold [space] while in the air to drop down.

If you are on top of a platform and release [space], the player will launch in the direction of the mouse (if the mouse is not inside the game screen, the direction will be the last position inside the screen).

The player can bounce off the sides of the screen.

The player will die when they hit the bottom of the screen, the game will end, and your score will be saved. You can then decide whether to retry or go to the start screen.
